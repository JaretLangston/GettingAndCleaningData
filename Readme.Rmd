run_analysis.R script combines the mean and standard devation observations 
from test and train datasets,removing the duplicate rows, and adding the subjectIDs 
and the Activities and produces an output file named combinedResults.csv.  

The dataset written to combinedResults.csv is used to produce a new dataset
grouped by SubjectID and Activity, and calculates the mean for the observations.
The new dataset is then written to the file combinedResults_mean.csv.

See the CodeBook.Rmd file for details of run_analysis.R.
